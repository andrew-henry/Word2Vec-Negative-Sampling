### What is Negative Sampling?

* A technique used to combat the inefficient training of a network in which we select a small subset of weights to update at a time. Modifications necessary are having two embedding layers (one for input words and the other for output words), and using a modified loss function for focus on the true example and a small subset of noise examples.
